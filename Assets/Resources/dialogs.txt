You feel the last bit of luck drain from your {0}. Your feel sudden clarity in your mind and full control over your body. You wonder what you're doing here playing games while your food gets cold. You excuse yourself and continue your way home. You stop at the next corner to wait for the light to change.

You're walking by yourself through town. The weather is becoming more brisk this time of year and you thought you'd better get out and enjoy the warmth before autumn fully sets in. You pick up some food for yourself to eat at home and take a moment to appreciate today's cloudless mid-afternoon sky. You have a moment of peace and start to head back home. You turn a corner and nearly bump into a small elderly man walking his equally old Pomeranian. Your pace slows as you notice on the ground a {0}. You hesitate before crouching down to pick it up. It's not like you, you think, to care about luck or superstition, but you feel compelled to pick it up.
You hear a faint, jolly voice from behind you. "It must be your lucky day...", they say. Holding the {0}, you glance over your shoulder, but nobody is there. You must have imagined it, you think, and head back on your way. While you walk toward your home, you rotate the {0} in your hand, inspecting it from all sides. It gives off a strange energy making you feel confident. Maybe it really is lucky, you think: you haven't had to stop at a red light to cross the street your whole walk home since finding it. You chalk it up to coincidence, but you're starting to feel a bit uneasy.
You stop suddenly in the middle of a block. You've walked this route a hundred times, but you've never noticed this emerald green door before. In fact you've never seen this whole building before. You feel mysteriously compelled to learn about it, and as you approach, a large burly bouncer emerges from the door.
"You sure you're in the right place, kid?" he says in a gruff voice. You don't know why, but you nod affirmatively. The bouncer sighs. "Alright, then let's see if you've got what it takes.." He reaches into his pocket and as he stretches out his arm, you brace yourself. You clutch the {0} tightly. You realize he's holding out a coin. "I'll take heads" he says with a slight smile. "Make sure you use that thing improve your odds."
---
The Bouncer wins with a heads. You gulp and hold your {0} tight.
---
"Huh, maybe it really is your lucky day, kid.", the Bouncer says. He beckons you through the door to a dark room with a lot of clatter and chatter.
"Maybe it's not your lucky day after all, kid. Let's try again."
---
It's too dark to make out anyone's face, but you can see several tables around the room, as well as a curtained doorway in the back. It seems like it leads to another room, and again you feel drawn toward it. As you start to walk toward the curtained doorway, someone stands up from a nearby table and comes up to you.
"Bruh, are you really headed back there, bruh?", the person says to you. Before you can nod your head, they say "Bruh, you just got here! I don't think you're ready to go back there. Besides, I've been looking to stomp some noobs and I can tell from you're one because you packed a lunch." You realize you're still holding your takeout bag and feel anger and embarrassment as this guy herds you toward the table they came from. You sit down across from them, still confused, when they place down a six-sided die and a lucky rabbit foot. You feel similar energy from their lucky rabbit foot as you do from your {0}, which you also place on the table. "I win if you get a 5 or above. Good luck, bruh, you'll need it," he says.
---
"Bruh" Bruh wins with a 3 or above on a six-sided die. How much luck will you use to win?
---
"Bruh... nice." You feel the energy of his lucky rabbit foot waning and your {0} becoming more strong.
"Sorry, bruh, I told you you weren't ready." he says. "Maybe I'll give you another shot"
---
You stand up from the table and feel several sets of eyes on you. You start to make your way to the back room, but just before you can reach the curtain another person approaches you. "That was some mighty fine work back there, sweetie" she says with a Southern drawl. "But look here, sweetie, not just any stranger who moseys on in here is allowed in the back room. I'll tell ya what, if you can beat me then I'll let you back there. But know I won't go easy on you, sweetie." She walks you to her table and places two dice and a horseshoe on it, and you return the gesture by placing down your {0}. You think you're getting the hang of this.
--
"Sweetie" Sweetie wins with a total of 3 and above on two six-sided dice. How much luck will you use to win?
--
"Yeehuh..??" You feel the luck of her horseshoe being absorbed by your {0}.
"Sorry, sweetie, but thems the breaks." she says. "I'll show you some Southern hospitality by givin' you another shot."
--
You stand up from the table and the room gets quiet. You walk through the curtain into the back room and see a private table. A well-dressed person is silently seated at the table, facing your direction, but you can't see their face. On the table is a laughing Buddha statue and a 20-sided die. You sit down without exchanging words and place down your {0}.
--
??? wins with a 13 and above on a 20-sided die. How much luck will you use to win?
--
"..."
--
"...WOOF!"
Suddenly the lights turn on. Sitting across from you is a dog in an ill-fitting suit, wagging its tail. Confused, you peer through the curtained door back into the main room. It's full of dogs. You try to call out to the people that you spoke with earlier, but only a bark escapes from you. You look at your body and realize that you are also a dog. You see a Pomeranian enter through the front-door, and in a voice that's so familiar, you hear it say "It must be your lucky day."
